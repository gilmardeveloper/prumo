## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Workspaces that bind repositories, documentation and PostgreSQL data sources, isolated from one
  another by construction.
- Tool window showing the current workspace, its repositories with role and access mode, and the
  policies — all denied by default.
- MCP surface with 25 tools: workspace context and policy, repository reading and Git state, IDE
  caret context, database introspection and read-only queries, and Prumo Packs.
- Read-only SQL execution with layered protection: read-only credential, read-only session and
  transaction, statement classification over the parsed syntax tree, row ceiling, timeout and a
  sanitized audit trail.
- Automatic masking of columns whose name announces a secret, with no configuration required.
- Prumo Packs: portable team knowledge, saved queries and confined scripts, with risk classification,
  an informed consent screen and an approval queue that only a human can act on.
- Assisted authoring: an AI client can read the pack specification, validate a draft and submit it —
  and cannot install it.
- Interface in English and Brazilian Portuguese, following the language configured in the IDE,
  with an optional override in *Settings · Tools · Prumo MCP* for those who keep the IDE in one
  language and prefer Prumo in another.
- Security suite named and separated (`./gradlew test -PsecurityOnly`), and CI running build, tests
  and plugin verification on Windows and Linux.
